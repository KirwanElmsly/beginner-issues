Simple Python script to aggregate GitHub issue search results for multiple labels.

So I couldn't figure out how to include multiple labels while searching GitHub issues so I quickly wrote up a Python script to aggregate results for multiple labels. Currently making it work as a simple web app with a Flask back end. I haven't really done much web development in the past so this is a learning process for me. This might take a while too as I don't have much time to work on it.

Feedback is appreciated! Feel free to message me with feedback or if you think this is stupid.
