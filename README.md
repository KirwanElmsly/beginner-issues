Simple Python script to aggregate GitHub issue search results for multiple labels.

So I couldn't figure out how to include multiple labels while searching GitHub issues so I quickly wrote up a Python script to aggregate results for multiple labels.

Feel free to message me with feedback or if you think this is stupid.


# Requirements
Developed using Python 3.6 but it should work on Python 3.x

Also depends on Requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
